On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
And I was thinking to myself,
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say...
I had to stop for the night
