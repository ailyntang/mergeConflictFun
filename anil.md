And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time
They say oh my God I see the way you shine
And oh my I, I, I like your style
