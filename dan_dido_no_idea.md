But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it
I'm in love and always will be
There will be no white flag above my door
I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
But I will go down with this ship
I know you think that I shouldn't still love you,
Or tell you that.
Or return to where we were
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
Where's the sense in that?
