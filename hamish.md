Deep down, see the sea ground, I'm getting close
And I'm going down like the Titanic
I love this show, but I won't see the second season
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down, go-going down
Yeah, it's kinda weird, these emotions all attacking me
It won't be the same with my favorite person leaving
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
Eyes so innocent, I didn't know you had a bad side
I don't want the answer, but how long this been happening?
I don't wanna sit and whine, we already toast
Yeah, I'm still going down, I'll be falling for a long time
