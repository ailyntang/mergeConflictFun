Under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
You gone like the way we rock it, so don't stop
All those things I should do to you
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
Got that good song in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
But you dance, dance, dance
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
