So tell me why my gods look like you
For you
I will keep on waiting for your love
I hate it when dudes try to chase me
So cold that your stare's 'bout to kill me
So, I'll wait
I love it when we play 1950
I'm suprised when you kiss me
But I love it when you try to save me
I'll pray
'Cause I'm just a lady
And tell me why it's wrong
