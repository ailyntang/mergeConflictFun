They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Either you're wrong or you're right
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
Yes we're one and the same
And a miracle has happened tonight
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
Now I believe in miracles
It don't matter if you're black or white
And I told about equality and it's true
Boy is that girl with you?
